Useful scripts that I use daily

## contador.sh 
Counter that can be used for literally anything, I normally use it to
count the amount of times my professor drinks water.
### Usage
contador.sh <input> 
where input can be:
+ ++ -> adds 1 to the counter
+ -- -> substracts 1 from the counter
+ reset -> resets counter
+ 'blank' -> to return value of counter
+ -h -> to get help or info on usage

note: the "-h" input returns the alias I have on my .bashrc file so
it's not really useful unless you set those variables yourself.
